    DF --> EM : Fetches input data
    EM --> CR : Mounts input data and executes container
    CR --> EM : Returns execution status and metadata
    EM --> RH : Passes execution results and metadata 
}
Executor --> OCI : Pulls container images
Executor --> AMS : Stores execution metadata
Executor --> ECS : Stores execution context and state
DPN --> Executor : Executes tasks on processing nodes
